# Tmux Commands

> The prefix key is set to `Ctrl + b` by default. You can change that to make it easier to reach it by adding the following line in `~/tmux.conf` file:    
> `set-option -g prefix C-a`  
> which sets the prefix to `Ctrl + a`.

> Another tip if you want to use your mouse to scroll and select panes, add the following to the `/tmux.conf` file:  
> `set -g mouse on`
